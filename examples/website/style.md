# Web Page Styling and Layout Guide

This document outlines the styling and layout specifications for the web pages of our project. Following these guidelines will ensure a uniform look across the site, providing a cohesive user experience and reinforcing our brand identity.

## Colors
Our color scheme consists of dark blue hues, complemented by yellow accents. The dark blue represents depth, expertise, and stability, subtly hinting at the expanse of the night sky. Yellow accents serve to highlight key elements, capturing attention and adding vibrancy to the overall design.

## Layout

1. **Navigation Bar**: At the top of each page, there will be a navigation bar. On the left-hand side of this bar, our logo will be displayed prominently. On the right-hand side, there should be a menu for page navigation and a language selector for user convenience.

2. **Carousel**: Directly beneath the navigation bar, we'll feature a carousel. It will automatically animate through five different images. Each image will have a central text overlay, placed on a semi-transparent background to ensure readability without obscuring the image. We will be using ngx-bootstrap for carousel implementation, creating a reusable Angular component for easy future edits.

3. **Slackline Text**: Following the carousel, there should be a section dedicated to slackline text. This section will provide key information or welcome messages to users in a brief, engaging manner.

4. **Info Boxes**: The next section will feature a 3x2 grid of infoboxes. These boxes can be used to highlight different features or sections of our project, providing users with quick, digestible information.

5. **Footer**: At the bottom of each page, there will be a fixed bar. This bar will contain a copyright notice and a link to the imprint, ensuring legal compliance and providing users with essential information.

## Pictures
The website imagery should have a dark, bluish tone, conveying a strong, technical, space agency aesthetic. We aim for an engineering effect rather than a science fiction one. This means images should reflect real-world technology development and engineering prowess. They should depict professional settings, advanced tools, and innovative materials, giving a subtle nod to the future while staying grounded in the realm of the possible.

By adhering to these guidelines, we will ensure that our website accurately reflects our brand identity, maintains user engagement, and delivers a seamless user experience.
