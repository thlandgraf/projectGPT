# Creating Midjourney Prompts
Creating a Midjourney prompt involves multiple steps and techniques to guide the AI in generating the image you envision. Here's a comprehensive guide:

1. **Start with a Basic Outline**: Think of yourself as an artist preparing to sketch a picture. Begin with a clear, simple description of the image you're looking to create. This could involve describing the main subject, the scene, or the small details you want to incorporate. For example, "A tranquil forest with a winding river and a small wooden bridge."

2. **Enhance with Style and Keywords**: Once you have your basic outline, it's time to add some style and keywords to make your image more engaging. The AI can emulate different styles like abstract, dream-like, or realistic. By choosing a style or adding relevant keywords, you can guide the AI to create an image that aligns with your vision. For instance, "A city skyline at dusk in the style of Van Gogh's Starry Night, with vibrant colors and swirling clouds."

3. **Master the Art of Aspect Ratios**: You can customize the aspect ratio of your generated image to fit your desired shape and size. To do this, add a double dash followed by the perfect ratio code (e.g., –ar 16:9 for a wide landscape image) at the end of your prompt. This ensures your masterpiece fits the dimensions you have in mind flawlessly.

4. **Use Advanced Settings**: Midjourney allows you to use advanced settings like seed, stylization, and chaos parameters to fine-tune your generated images. For example, the seed parameter (–seed [NUMBER]) allows you to control the randomness of your generated images, stylization (–s [NUMBER]) lets you glide between artistic styles, and chaos (–c [NUMBER]) allows you to control the initial image grid's randomness.

5. **Assign Weights**: By using the "::" notation, you can assign weights to different parts of your prompt. This allows you to control which elements of the image the AI should focus on more. For example, "[Eiffel Tower]::3 illuminated at night with [fireworks]::1."

6. **Use Remix Mode**: Remix mode allows you to create variations of your image based on the composition of your starting image. It's a great way to add a creative twist to your generated images.

7. **Add Color**: If you want your image to have specific colors, you can include that in your prompt. This can help set the mood and feel of the image. For example, "A lush enchanted forest with emerald-green foliage, magical creatures, and shimmering fairy lights."

Remember, these are guidelines, and the best way to get the results you want is to experiment. Try different combinations of styles, keywords, ratios, settings, weights, and colors to see what works best for your vision. Good luck with your creative journey with Midjourney!
